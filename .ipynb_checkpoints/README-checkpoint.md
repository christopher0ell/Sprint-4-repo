Vehicle Data Dashboard:
This project is an interactive web application developed with Streamlit. It allows users to explore and analyze a dataset of vehicles, visualize trends, and simulate random interactions with the data.

The dashboard includes interactive components like sliders, checkboxes, histograms, and scatter plots that enable users to filter, visualize, and interact with the dataset in real-time.

Project Overview:
This project simulates random events by allowing users to dynamically filter vehicle data and visualize it using charts. The dataset used contains information about vehicles, including their prices, model years, odometer readings, and more.

Key features:
Interactive filters for model year and odometer readings.
Histogram and scatter plots powered by Plotly Express.
Checkbox component to switch between filtered and unfiltered data views.
Real-time visualizations for exploring vehicle trends.

Technologies and Methods Used:
Python 3: Programming language used to build the project.
Streamlit: Framework for developing web-based dashboards.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis.
Plotly Express: Library for creating interactive visualizations.
Git: Version control to track changes and deploy the project to GitHub.
